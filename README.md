# Misinformation
This is the github repository for the MIT Department of Anthropology and CSAIL joint misinformation research project. 
The goal of this project is to figure out a way to analyze stance in the Twitter dataset from Lee et al. (2021) by looking at the language of the Tweets for stance markers.
This repository contains the supplementary material for the quantitative analysis conducted in our project.
